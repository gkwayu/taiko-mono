when requesting for Taiko faucet on the link Taiko Faucet: https://l2faucet.a1.taiko.xyz after creating a tweet and paste it on the url box i was expecting to see in the drop down menu request horse  but rather it's displaying ether and since i have already receive ether in the other side i can not request twice.

Kindly assist to check this, why on both faucet link youre getting Ether and not Horse.
